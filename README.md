# SOURCE
* Green Websites HUGO-DM1
# PURPOSE
* Try out some basic *list* and *single* code by going through the Hugo documentation
* There are no HTML headers or other structures
* Some content is still draft so won't appear. *More to do here*
* Trying out the process to deploy to github
* Changed **publishDir** to **docs** as required by Github Pages
* Changed **baseURL** from www.example.com to **/**
# NEXT STEPS
* try hugo -D to see if drafts are passed through
* then go through the git commands and see if re-deployment to live is automatic
